irfuproj_highest_RAPID_fluxes
=============================

Matlab routines based on irfu-matlab that are used to find events in Cluster magnetotail data with highest suprathermal electron fluxes. 

The routines were created as part of Andreas Lundin undergraduate course work. v1.0 is the original version of routines that has been later adopted for more flexible use.
